      ---## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
       1. **Clone the Repository**

bash
   git clone https://github.com/poushalimukherjee01/Country-Capital-Weather-Explorer.git

## 🔑 API Key Setup (Important)

1.Go to OpenWeatherMap
 and create a free account.

2.Copy your API key from the "API Keys" section in your OpenWeatherMap    dashboard.

3.In your project folder, you will see a file named config.example.js.

4.Make a copy of this file and rename it to config.js.

5.Open config.js and replace:

const API_KEY = "your_api_key_here";
with your own API key.

6.Save the file.

⚠️ Note:

config.js is listed in .gitignore, so it will never be pushed to GitHub (this keeps your key safe).

Only config.example.js is shared in the repo as a template.
